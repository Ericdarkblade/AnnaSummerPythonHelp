## Task 2

Create a new signal array with the formula:

![Signal Formula](Task%202%20Document%20Files/Python3_Task 2 Signal Formula.jpg)

where i ranges from [0,100)

then Use numpy to perform convolution which is the formula:

![Convolution](Task%202%20Document%20Files/Python3_Task 2 Convolution Formula.jpg)

using the filter array:

`filter_array = [1 / 16, 1 / 4, -3 / 8, 1 / 4, 1 / 16]` which was provided by the handout.

finally print the first 10 values of the convolution of the signal formula and the filter array:

### Output
```
0: 0.0
1: 2.4673686307462413e-06
2: 1.9738559419860492e-05

9: 0.000522623341971827
```

### Bonus Output

The assignment mentioned that it would be bonus to graph the original signal against the convolved signal. 
So I learned how to.
